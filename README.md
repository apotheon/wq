# wq

The wq utility automates some basic tasks involved in maintaining simplified
plaintext files containing lists of tasks to be completed, or already
completed, and optionally notes related to the list in a given file.

## Status

This project is on indefinite hold (already) due to the practical use-case in
my life going distinctly sideways, due to the apparently inherent tendency of
humans to destroy the systematic, elegant, and beautiful in use patterns of you
on't give them tools that encourage better behavior quickly enough.
