# wq

The wq utility automates some basic tasks involved in maintaining simplified
plaintext files containing lists of tasks to be completed, or already
completed, and optionally notes related to the list in a given file.

## Status

This project is on indefinite hold due to changes in priorities and conditions
for dogfooding during development.  Upon looking at this project again, I
realize I would need to rediscover the use case insights on which I originally
built the ideas for what to build.  Perhaps I will try again some day.
